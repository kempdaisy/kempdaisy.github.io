<h1>Designing a Website + Venting</h>
<h2>I'm making this website simply to try something new on my CAS experiences and add some originality to all the baking. Continue reading at your own risk</h2>
<div class="container">
    <p class="shaded"> If you're reading this, I wish you luck. If you have any position at my school please don't hold this against me, I'm purely trying to access my more creative side as well as letting out some feelings. Some would call this venting, sounds about right to me. Oh well, okay so, I tried to get an AI generator to write this introduction thing for me but it was so bad that I actually decided to just write it myself. I mean it must be bad if its got me writing my own introduction. Alright then, I like reading fictional books to escape this stressful, wierd, disgusting, boring world, obviosuly not non-fiction, why on earth would you want to read about the world you're already trying to escape, that's just...well... Anyway, maybe if you're trying to make sense of this whole world, but I don't have that kind of time being an IB student and everything. Anyway, there's this one Latin quote which is kind of interesting "aut inveniam viam aut faciam", which according to Pinterest (very reliable source by the way) means, "I shall either find a way, or make one". And I think thats a great mindset to live by. Anyyywayy, that's it for now. I need to attatch my socials below, but I don't think that is a great idea. I also need to add a photo so I'm just putting a picture of a cute puppy or something. </p>
